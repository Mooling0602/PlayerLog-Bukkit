# PlayerLog-Bukkit
A plugin blocks chat and joined/left messages from players that will be sent to the game client.

Designed for [MCDReforged](https://mcdreforged.com) plugins, especially BukkitChatManager, so you can manager game chat messages with Python codes easier than Java!
> BukkitChatManager is not a bukkit plugin, it's a MCDR/Python plugin!
